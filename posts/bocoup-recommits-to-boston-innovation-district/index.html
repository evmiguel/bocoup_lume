    <p>I am excited to announce that we are moving the Bocoup Loft to a new loft space in the Fort Point section of South Boston. The new location is conveniently located on the 3rd floor of 355 Congress Street, just above Lucky’s Lounge at the corner of Congress and A Street, a short walk from our previous location.</p>
<p>We decided to re-commit to <a href="http://www.innovationdistrict.org/">Boston’s Innovation District</a> because of the growing tech and start-up community in this area. Our exhaustive search for a new space in Boston confirmed that Fort Point’s Innovation District is the best place for us to support the growth of the Technology and Entrepreneurship community.</p>
<p>We plan to continue hosting Technology and Entrepreneurship lectures and meetups in our new location. In 2010, the Bocoup Loft hosted 42 events, with a combined attendance of more than 5,000 people. In 2011 we plan to host even more events and continue to be a home for Boston’s open source  and technology entrepreneurship community. We are always looking for partnerships, sponsorships and collaborations, so please <a onclick="Javascript: (function (racks){var msg='';for(var i in racks){msg += racks[i].replace(' ', '').split('').reverse().join('')}alert(msg)})(['nimda', 'ob@', 'moc.puoc']); return false" href="#">contact us</a> if you would like to get more involved.</p>
<p>The new Bocoup Loft will include a larger co-working space for Boston’s technologists and entrepreneurs, with more desks and a new lounge area geared towards community development and collaboration. In addition, the Bocoup Loft will also feature a larger, better equipped Open Source Room, where we will continue to host our events; lectures, meetups discussions and <a href="https://bocoup.com/education">training</a>.</p>
<p>We will be transitioning to our new space over the next few months and will be having a grand opening celebration in the spring. Stay tuned!</p>
