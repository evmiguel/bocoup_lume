    <p>Since I joined Bocoup just a few short weeks ago, I‚Äôve been spending a whole<br>
lot of time talking to <a href="http://twitter.com/jorydotcom">Jory Burson</a>.  She‚Äôs the<br>
<a href="https://bocoup.com/education">training</a> coordinator here, and she‚Äôs everything<br>
you‚Äôd want in a training coordinator at a place like Bocoup.  Most of our<br>
conversations have been focused on something we can‚Äôt help but notice: while lots<br>
of people can hack together enough JavaScript to accomplish a task, it can be a<br>
real struggle to learn how to write <em>quality</em> JavaScript ‚Äî the kind of code<br>
you‚Äôre proud to put your name on.</p>
<p>To that end, we‚Äôve developed an immersive one-day training aimed at people with a<br>
solid understanding of HTML and CSS who are ready to add a real understanding<br>
of JavaScript to their toolkit. The training is built on the belief that writing<br>
quality JavaScript is about more than just learning the various functions and<br>
syntax, or memorizing the jQuery API; it‚Äôs about learning how to <em>think</em> about<br>
the task you‚Äôre trying to accomplish with JavaScript. What are all the<br>
different steps of the task? How will you tie them together? How do you know<br>
that your code is doing what you expect? How do you track down and solve<br>
problems when they arise?</p>
<p>In short, how do you transition from the fairly static, presentation-oriented<br>
world of HTML and CSS, and learn to think like a developer?</p>
<h3>About the training</h3>
<p>I‚Äôll be leading the first all-day session of <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3568851531">Foundations of Programming with<br>
JavaScript</a> on July 20, 2012 at the<br>
Bocoup Loft in Boston. We won‚Äôt spend a lot of time talking theory ‚Äî instead,<br>
we‚Äôll dive right in by tackling the game of Hangman.  To start, we‚Äôll dissect<br>
the game from a developer‚Äôs perspective, breaking it down into the individual<br>
steps and units of functionality that make up a game of Hangman. Next, we‚Äôll<br>
work on each of those pieces, first as a group, and then in pairs. Along the<br>
way, you‚Äôll:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn about functions, arrays, and objects</li>
<li>explore how to share functionality using prototypal inheritance</li>
<li>get an introduction to the jQuery library</li>
<li>learn approaches for writing maintainable code</li>
<li>interact with tools for debugging and testing your JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>This is going to be a fast-paced day, so we‚Äôre expecting participants to have<br>
a firm grasp on HTML and CSS, as there won‚Äôt be time to get people up to speed.<br>
We‚Äôre also expecting students to be ready and willing to participate, to hunt down<br>
answers to questions, and to be prepared for their brains to hurt a bit at the<br>
end of the day üôÇ</p>
<h3>Is this training right for you?</h3>
<p>We don‚Äôt assume any knowledge of JavaScript, but because this training will<br>
focus heavily on learning via in-class exercises, we do want to make sure that<br>
you‚Äôre able to follow along and understand basic coding concepts. To that end,<br>
you‚Äôll want to make sure that you‚Äôre comfortable answering the <a href="https://gist.github.com/2764220">questions<br>
here</a> ‚Äì or at least making educated guesses! ‚Äì<br>
in order to get the most out of the training.  Still have questions? You can<br>
get in touch with us on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/bocouptraining">@bocouptraining</a>.</p>
