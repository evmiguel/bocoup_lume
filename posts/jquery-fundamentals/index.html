    <p>It was more than two years ago now that I <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2010/06/17/announcing-jquery-fundamentals-an-open-source-jquery-training-curriculum/">first published jQuery Fundamentals</a>, a free online jQuery learning resource. Since then, the site has seen hundreds of thousands of visits — if you’ve learned jQuery in the last two years, chances are decent that you’ve landed on the page at least once or twice.</p>
<p>A lot happens in the world of front-end development in two years, including some big changes to the jQuery library — 1.4 was the current version when the site came out, and there have been four major jQuery releases since then. Those releases brought a slew of changes, including a complete rewrite of <code>$.ajax</code> and friends, the introduction of deferreds and promises, new methods such as <code>.prop()</code>, and a much more streamlined event binding API via <code>.on()</code>. Slowly but surely, jQuery Fundamentals grew out of date.</p>
<p>Today, I’m beside-myself-excited to announce that Bocoup has launched a <a href="http://jqfundamentals.com">complete overhaul of jQuery Fundamentals</a>. We’ve rewritten the site from the ground up for jQuery 1.8, drawing on our experience in leading <a href="https://bocoup.com/education/">jQuery and JavaScript trainings</a>, and we’ve honed the content to target folks with HTML and CSS knowledge but little programming experience. We’ve also added a built-in editor, so you can try the examples as you learn.</p>
<p><a href="http://jqfundamentals.com"><img decoding="async" src="https://static.bocoup.com/blog/jquery-fundamentals.png"></a></p>
<p>More than a few people were puzzled that the original jQuery Fundamentals didn’t come with a price tag. I believed then that the content was more valuable if it was freely available than if it was locked behind a paywall or in a printed book, and since then, it’s been great to see it become a go-to resource for jQuery learning. Bocoup’s support of the overhaul and its commitment to the open web means that now, you can look forward to a much improved (and much more frequently updated) jQuery Fundamentals, with a price tag still set firmly at $0. We hope you like it.</p>
