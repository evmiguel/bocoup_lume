    <p>Over the past 3 months Bocoup has been working closely with the<br>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/guardian-interactive-department">Guardian Interactive team</a><br>
on <a href="http://misoproject.com/">the Miso Project</a>, a set of open source libraries designed to expedite and<br>
simplify the creation of data-driven interactive content. We are excited to announce<br>
the release of the first of these libraries<br>
called <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/">Dataset</a>.<br>
You can see the code <a href="http://www.github.com/misoproject/dataset">here on github</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/"><img decoding="async" src="https://static.bocoup.com/blog/dataset.png"></a></p>
<p>Traditionally, data-driven interactive applications require a series of steps that all follow<br>
a similar workflow. For example, remote data sources need to be fetched, the data is then<br>
parsed to match the client-side representation of the model and then perhaps transformed<br>
and queried to obtain the actual information required by the rendering layer. These steps<br>
can be individually accomplished through custom code or a collection of existing libraries<br>
and frameworks. When writing Dataset, we wanted to simplify this part of the workflow by<br>
creating a single library that managed the entire process.</p>
<p>Dataset comes with a growing list of <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/examples.html">examples</a><br>
that showcase not only its ease of use, but also how easy it is to integrate it into<br>
existing libraries. For example, here’s a quick bar chart showcasing Dataset’s own<br>
github repo commit history using jQuery Sparklines:</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px; border: 1px solid #222;" src="https://jsfiddle.net/iros/59R6V/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Some of Dataset’s facilities echo common patterns that we already see in MVC frameworks:<br>
easy tie-in to API endpoints and creating common client-side models that then make the data<br>
accessible. The Dataset structure is itself a similar abstraction to Backbone collections<br>
or Ember arrays for handling sets of data. While many frameworks provide these facilities<br>
for handling sets of data, our focus is on providing a more efficient implementation with<br>
more extensive APIs for manipulating the incoming data. By making data a first-class citizen<br>
in an MVC application, Dataset functions as a management layer that can be used as a step<br>
before, during or after an MVC framework like Backbone.js. It is our goal to grow the library<br>
in a way that facilitates interoperability with those frameworks and so we are looking<br>
forward to hearing how you might use it in your workflow.</p>
<h3>Available Features </h3>
<p>Dataset has a variety of features that try to cover the common set of functionality required by client-side data-driven applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/api.html#misoimporters">importers</a><br>
are responsible for fetching data from<br>
local and remote sources, like <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/tutorials/googlespreadsheets">google spreadsheets</a>.</li>
<li>A variety of <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/api.html#misoparsers">parsers</a> are waiting to transform the incoming data<br>
from formats such as CSV to our standard and fast-to-traverse format.</li>
<li>A series of <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/tutorials/products">computational functions</a> are available<br>
to easily obtain metrics about one or more columns in the data, such as min/max and groupBy.</li>
<li>A simple and powerful <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/tutorials/accessing_data">filtering API</a> that lets you create sub-selections<br>
of the data that match a particular set of conditions.</li>
<li>An <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/tutorials/events">event system</a> that allows subscription to specific data changes such as new rows being<br>
added or existing rows being updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Dataset was written to facilitate browser-based data management, thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/tbranyen">Tim Branyen</a>‘s<br>
efforts it is now also available as a <a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/tutorials/quickstart">node.js module</a>.</p>
<h3> Why We Built It</h3>
<p>At Bocoup, we are committed to moving the Open Web forward through developing new Open Web technologies for<br>
industries in transition to the web. We want to ensure that as this happens, the best software tools for doing so are open.</p>
<p>Inspired by the needs of journalism, we set out to work with the Guardian, a leader in Open Journalism,<br>
to develop Open Web data journalism tools. As we began building Dataset, we realised that its facilities<br>
are valuable for other software paradigms that we work on at Bocoup, and so we are excited to release<br>
a tool that that focuses on client-side data management.</p>
<p>We as web developers have a lot to learn about narrative and storytelling in our data focused web applications.<br>
In light of this, it is especially compelling for us to be focusing on an initiative<br>
like <a href="http://misoproject.com">the Miso Project</a> that bridges this gap.</p>
