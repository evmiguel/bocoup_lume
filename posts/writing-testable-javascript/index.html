    <p>The things we’re asking JavaScript to do are getting more and more complex by<br>
the day, and that means that manual testing — the good old “click around and<br>
make sure nothing’s broken” — is becoming less and less effective. If you’ve<br>
run into this in your work, you probably know that you ought to be doing<br>
automated testing, but if you’re like most front-end developers, then you<br>
probably don’t have a good idea of where to start.</p>
<p>Testing’s been on my mind quit a bit since I wrote <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/">A Baseline for Front-End<br>
Developers</a><br>
— testing was among one of many skill sets I identified as being key to being<br>
a productive and effective front-end developer these days. The resources on the<br>
web are surprisingly limited — one of the best is <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/7/Writing-Testable-JavaScript/">a post by Ben<br>
Cherry</a> from<br>
way back in 2010 — and so I wasn’t surprised by the answers when I asked<br>
people what was making it hard for them to get started with testing. You can<br>
see the whole thread<br>
<a href="http://storify.com/rmurphey/what-s-making-it-hard-to-get-started-with-js-testi">here</a>,<br>
but the conversation broke down into a few high-level topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which tools do I use?</li>
<li>Will testing slow me down?</li>
<li>How do I write testable code?</li>
<li>What do I test?</li>
<li>What do “good” tests look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve decided it’s time to bring tests into your workflow, but you’re<br>
struggling with answering these questions I’m excited to announce that I’ll be<br>
leading a two-day training, <a href="https://bocoup.com/education/classes/writing-testable-javascript/">Writing Testable JavaScript</a><br>
on Sept. 6-7 at the Bocoup Loft in Boston. During the course, we’ll:</p>
<ul>
<li>talk about how testing can improve your development process</li>
<li>look at patterns and practices that result in testable code</li>
<li>refactor common but untestable code patterns</li>
<li>explore how to write quality tests in both the BDD and assertion style</li>
<li>discover how to test code that depends on interaction with the server</li>
<li>use <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">grunt</a> to automate our testing and<br>
incorporate it into our development workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting started with testing can be rough — I freely admit that I needed a<br>
helping hand or three, and there was a whole lot that was confusing at first —<br>
but it turns out that it’s fairly straightforward (and possibly a little<br>
addictive) once you get over that initial hump. This training will help you do<br>
exactly that.</p>
<h3>Is this a good fit for you?</h3>
<p>This training is for moderately experienced JavaScript developers who are<br>
comfortable with git and the command line. If you’re wondering whether this<br>
training is right for you, I’d encourage you to set up and work through<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment">js-assessment</a>, a test-driven tool<br>
I developed for evaluating your JavaScript skills. Participants in this course<br>
should be able to get most (if not all) of the tests to pass.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about whether this training is a good fit, drop us<br>
a line at <a href="mailto:training@bocoup.com">training@bocoup.com</a> and we’d be happy<br>
to talk with you!</p>
